# custom-navbar
a basic Single Page Application that uses a navigation bar component to route between pages

## overview

This is a refactor of a basic page routing exercise using a web components and react components, utilizing a Bootstrap navigation bar. 

This project refactors the html and web components into a JSX application with routing provided by the react-router component.

A separate Navbar component provides the structure for the navigation, with `Link to` used to route between the pages without refreshing the single page.

The pages use boilerplate content as the focus of the exercise is on migrating the web components into react components and using the Boostrap Navbar component to provide navigation between the pages.

Cloning this repository will not provide the node_modules including the react-router component.
